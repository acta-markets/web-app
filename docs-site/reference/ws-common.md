# Acta WS Common Conventions

## Message envelope

All WS messages use:

```json
{ "type": "MessageType", "data": { ... } }
```

Unit variants may omit `data`, for example:

```json
{ "type": "Logout" }
```

## Encodings and units

| Field | Format |
|-------|--------|
| Pubkeys | base58 |
| Signatures | base58 (64 bytes) |
| `order_id` | 64-char hex (optional `0x` prefix) |
| `price` | `u64`, gross premium per 1 underlying unit, 1e9 scale |
| `total_premium` | `u64`, net premium amount in quote token atomic units |
| `strike` | `u64`, quote per 1 underlying unit, 1e9 scale |
| `quantity` | `u64`, underlying atomic units |
| `size_rule` | min_size, max_size, step in underlying atomic units; always tied to underlying_mint |
| Timestamps | Unix seconds |
| `server_time_unix_ms` | Unix milliseconds |

`price` and `strike` are always 1e9 fixed-point per 1 underlying unit, independent of mint decimals.


## Quantity and collateral by position type

`quantity` on the wire is always in underlying atomic units, regardless of position type.
The two position types differ in what the user deposits as collateral:

**Covered call** — user deposits underlying (e.g. SOL).
`quantity` maps directly to the deposit: `quantity = userInput * 10^underlying_decimals`.

**Cash-secured put** — user deposits quote (e.g. USDC).
The collateral relationship is: `collateral = quantity * strike / 1e9`.
Convert quote input to underlying quantity before sending:

```
quantity = round(quoteAmount * 10^underlying_decimals * 1e9 / strike)
```

And to display the deposit back in quote terms:

```
quoteAmount = quantity * strike / 1e9 / 10^underlying_decimals
```

`underlying_decimals` comes from `MarketDescriptorInfo`.

### Size rule display for CSP

`size_rule` values (min_size, max_size, step) are in underlying atomic units.
To show constraints in quote terms for a CSP UI, apply the same conversion:

```
min_quote = min_size * strike / 1e9 / 10^underlying_decimals
max_quote = max_size * strike / 1e9 / 10^underlying_decimals
step_quote = step    * strike / 1e9 / 10^underlying_decimals
```

Example: SOL/USDC CSP, strike $90 (90e9), `size_rule = {min: 1e9, max: 10e9, step: 1e8}`:

| Wire (SOL lamports) | Display (USDC) |
|---------------------|----------------|
| min_size = 1,000,000,000 | 90 USDC |
| max_size = 10,000,000,000 | 900 USDC |
| step = 100,000,000 | 9 USDC |

The TS SDK provides helpers for these conversions: `quoteAmountToQuantity`,
`quantityToQuoteAmount`, `sizeRuleInQuoteTerms` (exported from `@acta-markets/ts-sdk/ws`).

## Time and clock skew

`server_time_unix_ms` is present in:
- `Welcome.server_time_unix_ms` (optional)
- `Pong.server_time_unix_ms` (required)

`Snapshot` does not include `server_time_unix_ms` in current protocol.

Client estimate:

```
offset_ms = server_time_unix_ms - local_time_ms
estimated_server_now_ms = local_time_ms + offset_ms
```

Use this estimate for `expires_at`, `valid_until`, and `signature_deadline`.

## Authentication protocol

### Signing algorithm

Ed25519. Signatures are 64 bytes, base58-encoded on the wire.

### Challenge format

After the client sends `Hello` and receives `Welcome`, the server sends `AuthRequest` with a `challenge` field. The challenge is a multiline plaintext string. The format differs by role:

**Taker challenge** (includes `Wallet:` line):

```
Acta RFQ Authentication

Sign this message to authenticate your wallet.

Wallet: {base58_pubkey}
Nonce: {hex_encoded_32_random_bytes}
Issued At: {RFC3339_timestamp}
```

**Maker challenge** (no `Wallet:` line):

```
Acta RFQ Authentication

Sign this message to authenticate your wallet.

Nonce: {hex_encoded_32_random_bytes}
Issued At: {RFC3339_timestamp}
```

Makers do not need a `Wallet:` line. The server identifies the maker from `AuthChallenge.pubkey`, then looks up the registered signing key from the on-chain maker registry.

### What to sign

Sign the raw bytes of the challenge string (`challenge.as_bytes()` in UTF-8). No additional prefix, domain separator, or hashing before signing.

### AuthChallenge (client -> server)

```json
{
  "type": "AuthChallenge",
  "data": {
    "challenge": "Acta RFQ Authentication\n\nSign this message...",
    "signature": "3q7uQqYc3...base58sig",
    "pubkey": "PubkeyBase58"
  }
}
```

**Maker**: `pubkey` is the `maker_owner` pubkey registered on-chain. Sign the challenge with your **auth signing key**; the server looks up `maker_owner` and verifies against the registered auth signing key. (A maker currently registers a single on-chain key that serves as both the auth and quote signing key, so either works today — but sign the auth challenge with the auth key and quote payloads with the quote key, in case the contract later provisions separate keys.)

**Taker**: `pubkey` is the taker's wallet pubkey (same as the `Wallet:` value in the challenge). The signature is verified directly against this key.

### Auth constraints

- Max auth attempts per connection: `3`. After 3 failures, connection is closed.
- Auth deadline after challenge issued: `15s`.

### Ping / Pong

```json
{ "type": "Ping" }
```

`Ping` is a unit variant (no `data` field). Server responds with:

```json
{
  "type": "Pong",
  "data": {
    "server_time_unix_ms": 1710000000000
  }
}
```

Clients should send `Ping` every ~30s to avoid the 90s idle timeout.

### Logout

```json
{ "type": "Logout" }
```

Unit variant, no `data` field. Server responds with `LogoutSuccess` and closes the connection.

```json
{ "type": "LogoutSuccess" }
```

## Fee model

The protocol charges a fee per trade, configured per quote mint in basis points (bps). The on-chain config stores two fee rates: `protocol_fee_bps_premium` and `protocol_fee_bps_volume`.

- `price` in the `Quote` message is the **gross premium per 1 underlying unit** (1e9 scale). This is what the maker signs and what goes into the order_id preimage as `gross_price`.
- On chain, gross premium is first scaled to quote-token atomic units. The premium-side fee is computed from `protocol_fee_bps_premium`; the volume-side cap is computed from strike notional and `protocol_fee_bps_volume`; the charged fee is `min(premium_fee, volume_fee)`.
- `net_price` in WebSocket payloads is a display approximation. The authoritative amount is the on-chain net premium after the min(premium-fee, volume-fee) calculation and token-decimal scaling.
- `total_premium` in position data is the net premium from on-chain state (in quote token atomic units).
- Makers always quote gross. The fee does not affect what the maker signs; it is applied by the contract at position open.

## Auth messages

### AuthSuccess

```json
{
  "type": "AuthSuccess",
  "data": {
    "session_id": "uuid",
    "expires_at": 1710086400,
    "maker_pda": "MakerPdaBase58"
  }
}
```

`expires_at` wire contract:
- Wire type is `Option<i64>` — number (Unix seconds) when a session expiry is set, `null` otherwise. The key is always present.
- Used for session resume by both makers and takers.

`maker_pda` wire contract:
- Set to the on-chain maker account PDA (base58) for authenticated **makers** that are registered on-chain.
- `null` (and omitted from the wire on serialization) for non-makers (admins, takers) and for makers not yet registered on-chain.

### AuthError

```json
{
  "type": "AuthError",
  "data": {
    "reason": "session_expired",
    "message": "optional detail"
  }
}
```

`reason` is a `snake_case` code. `message` is optional and may be omitted.

Current `reason` codes:
- `session_expired`, `already_authenticated`
- `auth_timeout`, `too_many_auth_attempts`
- `invalid_pubkey`, `invalid_signature`, `pubkey_mismatch`, `challenge_mismatch`
- `maker_not_registered`

## Error format

Two error message types exist:

### Error — connection-level errors

Sent when no `request_id` is available (the message had no `request_id` field, or the error
occurred before routing):

```json
{ "type": "Error", "data": { "type": "RfqNotFound" } }
```

`data` is a tagged `ServerError` variant (`type` + optional nested `data`).

### RequestError — request-correlated errors

Sent when the server can correlate the failure to a specific client request. The `request_id`
echoes the client's `request_id` from the originating message:

```json
{
  "type": "RequestError",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "error": { "type": "RfqNotFound" }
  }
}
```

The inner `error` has the same `ServerError` shape as `Error.data`.

Prefer `RequestError` handlers over `Error` handlers wherever you pass `request_id` in requests.
Both events fire `error` in the TypeScript SDK (see [Web client SDK](../quickstart/web-client-ts-sdk.md)).

### Parsing rule (applies to both `Error.data` and `RequestError.data.error`)

1. Branch on `type`.
2. If `type != "Generic"`, treat it as a typed variant.
3. If `type == "Generic"`, branch on `data.code`.

Generic code example:

```json
{
  "type": "Error",
  "data": {
    "type": "Generic",
    "data": { "code": "parse_error", "message": "invalid payload" }
  }
}
```

Typed variant examples:

```json
{ "type": "Error", "data": { "type": "RfqNotFound" } }
```

```json
{
  "type": "Error",
  "data": {
    "type": "Unauthenticated",
    "data": { "action": "submit_quotes" }
  }
}
```

### Common `generic.code` values

- `parse_error`
- `message_too_large`
- `too_many_parse_errors`
- `hello_required`
- `hello_timeout`
- `hello_already_sent`
- `session_replaced`
- `session_expired`
- `already_authenticated`
- `trading_paused`
- `internal_error`

This list grows over time; keep a fallback branch for unknown codes.

## Correlation semantics

There's no single global correlation id. Correlation is per-request, via the `request_id` field on messages that have a defined response.

- `Subscribe` / `Unsubscribe` carry a mandatory `request_id`. The server echoes it in `SubscribeAck` / `UnsubscribeAck`, and the `subscribed` / `unsubscribed` arrays contain only the diff for this call — not the full subscription list.
- `GetSubscriptions` carries `request_id`; `Subscriptions` echoes it.
- Query-style `Get*` operations require `request_id` and echo it in their responses.
- On failure, the server emits `RequestError` (with `request_id`) when the request carried one, otherwise `Error` (no `request_id`) for connection-level failures.
- Indicative pricing uses `request_id` on both `IndicativePricesRequest` (server → maker) and `IndicativePricesResponse` (maker → server).
- Broadcasts (`RfqBroadcast`, `TradeExecuted`, `StatsUpdate`, etc.) don't carry `request_id`.

### SubscribeAck / UnsubscribeAck

```json
{
  "type": "SubscribeAck",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "subscribed": ["rfqs", "trades"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "UnsubscribeAck",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "unsubscribed": ["stats"]
  }
}
```

`subscribed` / `unsubscribed` are the channels that were actually added or removed —
channels already subscribed (or already absent) are not repeated.

## Lifecycle terms

Use the same terms across all external docs:

### RFQ lifecycle
- **Terminal RFQ event**: `RfqClosed`. Close RFQ state only on this event.
- **Fill-details event (maker)**: `QuoteFilled`. Contains fill details for the winning maker.
- **Order-level confirmation (taker)**: `OrderConfirmed`. Confirms selected order with
  on-chain identifiers (`tx_signature`, `position_pda`).

### Position lifecycle (post-fill)
- `open` — position created, collateral locked, premium paid to taker.
- `funded` — maker deposited settlement asset via `DepositFundsToPosition`.
- `settled` — market finalized, assets distributed based on ITM/OTM outcome.
- `liquidated` — an unfunded ITM position was closed by a liquidation transaction.

Trade lifecycle and payoff: [Protocol flow](protocol-flow.md).

## Supported channels

`WsChannel` values and what each carries. Channels are role-oriented — subscribe only to the ones your role consumes.

| Channel | Producer(s) | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| `rfqs` | `RfqBroadcast`, `IndicativePricesRequest`, quote/order lifecycle | **Makers.** Takers do not subscribe — a taker's own RFQ/quote/order events (`RfqCreated`, `QuoteReceived`, `OrderAccepted`, `SponsoredTxToSign`, `Order*`, `RfqClosed`) are delivered session-addressed regardless of subscription. |
| `trades` | `TradeExecuted` | Public trade tape. Participants also receive their own fills session-addressed. |
| `stats` | `StatsUpdate` | Global venue stats. |
| `chain_events` | `ChainEvent` (position opened / settled / liquidated, market finalized) | Anyone. **This is how a taker tracks position outcomes** (settlement / liquidation). |
| `markets` | `MarketCreated`, `MarketFinalized` | Anyone tracking the tradable market set. |
| `positions` | — (no public producer) | `PositionUpdated` is delivered **owner-direct to the maker's session** by PDA lookup, never via this channel. The channel yields nothing for takers. |

Takers typically subscribe to `chain_events` (position outcomes) plus optionally `trades` / `stats` / `markets`. They do **not** need `rfqs` or `positions`.

## Timeout hierarchy

```
market.expiry_ts
  └─ rfq.expires_at                     # Auction window (no new quotes or accepts after this)
       └─ quote_refresh_margin

quote.valid_until                        # Cryptographic expiry (on-chain enforcement)
  └─ effective_expiry                    # = valid_until - settlement_buffer (server-side trading cutoff)

rfq.signature_deadline
  └─ tx_submit_timeout
```

### `rfq.expires_at` vs `quote.valid_until`

`expires_at` is the auction deadline. `valid_until` is the on-chain order validity.

- **`rfq.expires_at`** controls how long makers can submit quotes and the taker can accept. After this time the server closes the RFQ.
- **`quote.valid_until`** is the cryptographic expiry the maker signs into the order. The on-chain program rejects settlement if `valid_until` has passed.

`valid_until` is always larger than `expires_at` because settlement happens *after* the auction ends. A taker might accept a quote at second 59 of a 60-second auction. After that, the server builds a sponsored tx, the taker signs it, and the tx confirms on Solana. This can take up to 300 seconds. If `valid_until` equaled `expires_at`, the on-chain order would expire before the tx lands.

### Recommended `valid_until` range

```
min:  now + min_signature_expiry_seconds          (default 310s)
max:  rfq.expires_at + settlement_buffer_seconds  (recommended upper bound)
```

Setting `valid_until` above the recommended max is not rejected by the server,
but provides no benefit: after `rfq.expires_at` the server will not allow
accepts, so extra on-chain validity only increases the maker's exposure window
without enabling any additional trades.

Example: RFQ with `expires_at = now + 60s`, settlement buffer 300s:

```
valid_until range: [now + 310s, now + 360s]
effective_expiry:  [now + 10s,  now + 60s]
```

The maker's quote is tradeable for up to 60 seconds (the full RFQ lifetime)
and the on-chain order is valid long enough for settlement to land.

### Invariants

- `quote.valid_until >= now + min_signature_expiry_seconds` (default 310s; server rejects shorter expiries)
- `effective_expiry = quote.valid_until - settlement_buffer` (default 300s)
- `rfq.expires_at < market.expiry_ts` (recommended client-side validation)
- `signature_deadline <= min(effective_expiry, rfq.expires_at)`

`signature_deadline` appears in `QuoteSelected` (server -> maker; see [maker-api.md](maker-api.md)) and `SponsoredTxToSign` (server -> taker; see [taker-api.md](taker-api.md)).

## Reconciliation safety

Use entity versions where available:
- `rfq_version` for RFQ lifecycle progression
- `order_version` for order lifecycle progression

`order_version` is currently present on order lifecycle push events
(`OrderSubmitted`, `OrderConfirmed`, `OrderFailed`) and not on `OrderStatusMessage`.

On client side:
- apply update only if `new_version > current_version`
- ignore stale updates (`new_version < current_version`)
